# Decisions

## 2026-08-15 — Phase 0 is contract only

The repository contains documentation and empty layout directories. No Godot project, Nakama runtime, Docker Compose stack, or gameplay code is included in Phase 0.

## 2026-08-15 — Repository path

The working tree is `C:\Users\Eszter\small-mmorpg`. `C:\Users\Eszter\Documents\small-mmorpg` is not used. Godot must not import the repo root; `client/project.godot` does not exist until a later phase.

## 2026-08-15 — Directory names

`server/` holds the future Nakama TypeScript runtime (not `nakama-runtime/`). `content/source/` holds authored JSON (not `content/data/`).

## 2026-08-15 — Prior scaffolding discarded

An earlier experimental Godot/Nakama tree in this folder was removed so Phase 0 matches the empty-repository contract. Nothing from that tree is authoritative.

## 2026-08-15 — Postgres image tag

The exact Postgres Docker tag is deferred to the infra phase. Nakama 3.40.0 remains the server pin. No custom SQL tables.

## 2026-08-15 — nakama-runtime install source

Version 1.47.0 is the Heroic Labs `nakama-common` tag. The npm package name is `nakama-runtime`. Install from Git, not an unpublished npm version number.
